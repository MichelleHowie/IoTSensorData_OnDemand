= Project: IoTSensorData_OnDemand

This project allows you to request sensor data on demand from your IoT device.

In this project we used an Arduino MKR NB 1500 with Environmental Shield.
The Arduino sketch posts sensor data from the board as a json string to the IoT broker.
By sending an SMS to the TelstraDev Messaging API gateway, the request enters the nodered flow. 
The sensor data is in NodeRed flow as a global variable, pulled from the IoT broker.
The requested sensor data is processed in NodeRed flow and composed in an SMS back to the user.
We validate the data to match specific key words (which sensor do you want data from).

See the over all flow architecture: https://github.com/MichelleHowie/IoTSensorData_OnDemand/blob/master/IoTSensorData_OnDemand%20nodered%20flow%20diagram.png

This workshop was recorded live at Call for Code June 2020: https://video.ibm.com/channel/23832688/video/cfc2020-telstradev-iotworkshop 

Using the NB IOT network with a Telstra SIM, the MKR NB 1500 can be contacted from almost anywhere in Australia.
You can send the data requests remotely.

For part 1 of this workshop, to learn how to set up your Messaging API with node red and program the Arduino board, 
See the video recap of this tutorial recorded at IBM's Call For Code May 2020 Hackathon:

And part 3 where we use the Arduino MKR NB 1500 on Telstra's Cat-M1 network to alert when acceleration on the z axis is high (inferring a falling device!): https://github.com/MichelleHowie/Arduino-MKR-IMU-Fall-Detect

=== Requirements:

Arduino ENV Sensor shield

https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/ibmcloud[IBM Cloud NodeRed]

https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-iot-platform[Watson IoT Broker]




== Step 1: Set-Up the Arduino Board
To set-up your board, and connect to the NB IoT cellular network, 
Follow the Arduino MKR NB 1500 Get Started Guide on TelstraDev IoT Marketplace

https://dev.telstra.com/sites/default/files/assets/Arduino-MKR-NB-1500-Starter-Guide.pdf 

== Step 2: Register the Devices in WatsonIoT
Login to IBM Cloud

go to catalogue and find the IoT platform: https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/internet-of-things-platform 

create a lite (free) plan

go to devices and 'add device'

enter a meaningful device type (e.g "arduinomkr")

enter a meaningful name (e.g "mydevice1")

all the other fields are optional

select 'Finish'

STOP! make sure you copy all the text on this page: ORG, DEVICE TYPE, DEVICE, AUTH METHOD, AUTH TOKEN
IMPORTANT! you will not have access to the token again. save this somewhere you can access it. 
If you lose your device token, you will need to add a new device and start again.

you then need to create a new app from the left screen toolbar. Generate API Key

save your api key and token. they will be needed in your node red instance

change the role of this app to be backend trusted app

== Step 3: Create NodeRed instance
Go to https://nodered.org/

Get started with NodeRed here:  https://developer.ibm.com/components/node-red/gettingstarted/

If you have an Openshift account, you can run an instance in IBM cloud,
You can select a local instance of nodered.

Import the IoTSensorData_OnDemand rode red flows (without client creds).json file containing the demo flow:
https://github.com/MichelleHowie/IoTSensorData_OnDemand/blob/master/IoTSensorData_OnDemand%20rode%20red%20flows%20(without%20client%20creds).json

Here is a schematic of what it should look like: 
https://github.com/MichelleHowie/IoTSensorData_OnDemand/blob/master/IoTSensorData_OnDemand%20nodered%20flow%20diagram.png

In the "Get a Token" node, replace 'INSERT_HERE' with your valid TelstraDev Messaging API client credentials (see next step)

Take note of the HTTP endpoint in the "SMS in" node, as you will need this when provisioning your Messaging API mobile number below

== Step 4: Set-Up Messaging API

Register your free developer account at https://dev.telstra.com.

Login and navigate to the My apps page.

Create your application by clicking the 'Add new app' button

Select API Free Trial Product when configuring your application. This Product includes the Telstra Messaging API as well as other free trial APIs. Your application will be approved automatically.

There is a maximum of 1000 free messages per developer. Additional messages and features can be purchased by creating a company and adding billing details. 

Note your Client key and Client secret as these will be needed to provision a number for your application and for authentication (see NodeRed "Get a Token" node).

Now head over to Getting Started where you can find a postman collection as well as some links to sample apps and SDKs to get you started.

Download the MessagingAPI-SDK in the language of your choice from https://github.com/telstra 

  Get Token
  Get Subscriptions (define the NotifyURL endpoint in this call)
  Note the new subscription mobile number / MSISDN (e.g 61412345678). This is your virtual number
  Send a text to your new virtual number
  Send a text from your new virtual number

The notifyURL in the Provisoning call will be the URL where replies to the provisioned number will be posted
Telstra will deliver messages sent to that dedicated number to the notifyURL defined by you. 
The notifyURL should be a complete URL address which includes the protocol identifier (e.g. https://). 
It should also have a forward slash at the end if it is just a domain (e.g. http://www.example.com/).

For this project, the notifyURL is based off of your nodered URL:
['notify_url'] = "http://nr3-devsteve-test.toddler-ocp43-au-5290c8c8e5797924dc1ad5d1b85b37c0-0000.au-syd.containers.appdomain.cloud/api/sms";

If that NotifyURL is the correct nodered http in endpoint, you should see the message payload of any inbound messages to your number appear in nodered 'SMS in' node
it's then matched to the possible requests for sensor data (temp, UV, humidity, light)
the most recent sensor data is pulled every 30 seconds from watson IoT and stored in the nodered global variables.
The matched word + the matching global variables + time of latest data from sensors + information from the inbound text ('from' address) make up the response to send an SMS reply using another http request 
(i.e another call to the TelstraDev Messaging API Gateway)


BEFORE Deploying the NodeRed flow, make sure you have provisioned a mobile number with the TelstraDev Messaging API.
Take note of this number, as it is the address for you to text your sensor data requests to.


== Step 5: Prepare Arduino Sketch

Download the Arduino sketch https://github.com/MichelleHowie/IoTSensorData_OnDemand/tree/master/Environmental_Sensor_Data_Push

Add your secrets from the Waston IoT platform (token, device name)

Connect your env sensor shield

Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board

== Step 6: Deploy and Test!
Deploy the NodeRed Flow

Send a text to your virtual number requesting sensor data. 

If your text does not match with one of the key words (temp, humidity, light, UV) then you will be sent a help menu


FIN!
